"1It is assumed that fresh green beans are cooked prior to consumption. The USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) reports that cooking one ounce of raw green beans yields 24 grams of cooked vegetable, indicating a preparation yield of about 84.7 percent. ",,,,,,

"2The liquid contents of the can are discarded prior to consumption. Based on the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), ERS further assumes that 65 percent of the can's gross weight is solid and 35 percent is liquid medium. The FPED cup equivalent weight for canned green beans is the weight of the solids and not of the liquid medium in which the vegetable is packed. The preparation yield factor for canned green beans in the above table does not account for any further preparation that occurs prior to consumption.",,,,,,

"3ERS assumes that consumers cook frozen green beans. The FNDDS reports that cooking ten ounces of frozen green beans yields 256 grams of cooked vegetable, indicating a preparation yield of about 90.3 percent.",,,,,,
