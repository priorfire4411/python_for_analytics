    "* Show the output of your code working on the sample data, like below.  \n",
    "* If techniques are specified, use them.  Otherwise, feel free to solve the problem how you want.  \n",
    "* Try to keep your code clean, concise and avoid loops if necessary.  \n",
    "* You have to show your work (code).\n",
    "* You will be graded:\n",
    "    * The functionality of your code (Does it do what it was meant to)\n",
    "    * Showing the output on the sample data provided\n",
    "    * How concise it is (did you use a for loop when you could have used a comprehension for instance).  Simply put, try and write clean, concise and readable code (don't use 10 lines for what could have been done in 4).\n",
    "    * Even if the answer isn't perfect, make an honest attempt as partial credit will be given.\n",
    "* you should not have to explicitly use  a for loop except for question 12, meaning it is possible to complete the entire assignment without using the keyword \"for\".\n",
    "* the only third party functions/modules you are allowed to use are permutations and combinations from itertools.  yes, there is a built in median function in numpy, but the idea is to program yourself and solve the problems on your own using basic python techniques"
